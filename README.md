# dragon_compiler
A recursive-descent compiler as described in EECS 6083/5183 by Philip A. Wilsey and "The Dragon Book" 1st Edition.


Work is currently being done in Python to get a feel for compiler design. Once more of the theory is understood, I hope to switch to ADA to develop the compiler.

The goal is to fully understand how a compiler works as well as LLVM code generation, allowing my studies in the Compiler Design class to focus on optimization as well as trying out other methods or lexing/parsing/scanning, and to add some more advanced features and syntax to my compiler such as inline assembly.
